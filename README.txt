Gabriel's Auto Mapper v1.00

Get Started
  When in folder run:
  For optimal functionality, PLACE YOUR GRAPH AND CO FILES into the data folder.

  $java MapCoordinates [MyGraphFile.gr] [MyCoordFile.co] [SourceNodeID] [DestNodeID]

  Then open index.html to see your shortest path mapped into the map.

Example:
  Without changing anything, run in Terminal
  java MapCoordinates ny.gr ny.co 90 2301

  Open index.html and zoom into New York State.
