There are two data files in this directory, both are for the roads of
New York City. The .gr file is the graph file, a list of edges and the
weights between them. Each line that contains an edge starts with the
character 'a'. It is followed by the id of the starting node, then the
id of the ending node, finally the weight of that edge.

The .co file is the coordinates file. Every vertex line begins with the
character 'v'. It is followed by the node id and then the longitude and
latitude given in decimal degrees to 6 significant places. ex: -73530767
is -73.3530767 degrees longitude.

The last file in this directory is an example file of how to draw onto
google maps.
